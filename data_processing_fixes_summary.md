# Data Processing Fixes Summary

## Overview
I've implemented comprehensive fixes to the data processing pipeline to address the core issue of models not answering questions on topic. The main problem was that the original system only extracted assistant responses without preserving conversation context, preventing models from learning proper instruction-following behavior.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed OpenAssistant Data Processing**
**File**: `data_modules/conversational/openassistant.py`

**Before**: Only extracted assistant responses without context
```python
# Old problematic approach
assistant_messages = train_data.filter(
    lambda x: x["role"] == "assistant" and x["lang"] == "en"
)
```

**After**: Builds complete conversation threads with Human-Assistant context
```python
# New approach - builds full conversation threads
conversations = self._build_conversation_threads(train_data)
formatted_text = self._format_conversation_thread(conversation)
# Result: "Human: [question]\n\nAssistant: [response]"
```

**Impact**: Models now learn from complete instruction-response pairs instead of isolated responses.

### 2. **Improved Anthropic HH Data Processing**
**File**: `data_modules/conversational/anthropic_hh.py`

**Changes**:
- Preserves full conversation context from HH-RLHF dataset
- Formats conversations as proper Human/Assistant exchanges
- Filters out refusal responses to focus on helpful examples
- Maintains conversation quality through better filtering

**Impact**: Higher quality instruction-following examples with proper context.

### 3. **Enhanced Conversation Formatting**
**Files**: `train.py`, multiple dataset loaders

**New Format Standard**:
```
Human: [User question or instruction]
